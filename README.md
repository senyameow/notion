# Notion

Software for writing, learning, sharing your thoughts with others.

## Motivation

**`20% input - 80% output`**

My motivation was official Notion website. I've been using that app for almost 2 years now for my own purposes and all the time I've been thinking about building something similar, but with my changes. I think it can be really usefull tool for the most valuable skill in 21th century, which is writing. It turned out that not a lot of people know about Notion, so I can share with my friends and hopefully make their lives better.


```bash
npm get started =)
```

## Why to use it?

**`Clarify your thoughts by writing`**

- putting thoughts on paper
- practice writing
- language learning
- computer science notes
- writing scripts

In todays world we have abundance of input, but we're lacking output. Whether you want to embark on writing journey or learn new language, write math notes or write script for your history presentation. Anyone can find something benefitial in it.



## How did I build it?

* **`NextJS`**. the most powerful framework for building React applications
* **`Typescript`**. Type safety + 
* **`Clerk`**. flexible authentication.
* **`Convex`**. realtime BaaS db.
* **`Tailwind`**. Easy and fast to write styles.
* **`BlockNote`**. Notion-style editor
* **`Edgestore`**. File upload
* **`Zod + React-hook-form`**. Type-safe forms.

etc..



## How does my project stand out?

As it turns out lots of people find official Notion hard to navigate through. And it's true. On one hand it's amazing, isn't it? You can literally do whatever you want. On the other, it's unnecessary. So I decided to create minimalistic version, but still with some features. 
Here are some of them:

* ## interactions with other people
* Ban, give roles, check profiles of people who visited your page
